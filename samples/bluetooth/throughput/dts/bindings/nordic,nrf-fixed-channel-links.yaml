  Nordic Fixed Channel Links

  Contains common bindings that describe fixed (hardwired) channel connections
  from a peripheral node to another peripheral node.

      description: |
        A list of ranges of linked channels between this peripheral node and
        another peripheral node. The prop is encoded as
        <&phandle src-ch-start dst-ch-start count>, where:
        - phandle is the phandle of the linked peripheral node
        - src-ch-start is the starting index of the channel range in this node
        - dst-ch-start is the starting index of the channel range in the linked
          node
        - count is the number of consecutive linked channels starting at the
          start indices

fixed-channel-link-cells:
  - src-ch-start
  - dst-ch-start
  - count
