description: Nordic IPCT Channel Map

properties:
    source-channel-links:
      type: array
      description: |
        Mapping of IPCT channels that are mapped between two IPCT instances on
        separate domains, in which a channel on this IPCT node is considered
        the source. This array is then comprised of a 3-integer-wide "unit"
        that defines one connection of the mapping. The format of this unit
        is <source_channel sink_domain_id sink_channel>. Units are sequential
        in the array, therefore requiring the length of this property to be
        a factor of 3.

        For example, if channel 2 is to be mapped to Secure Domain (ID: 1) IPCT
        channel 4, then the array "unit" would be <2 1 4>.
